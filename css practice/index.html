        <p> I stay home, even when I have symptoms of COVID-19. I exercise when I need to, especially during class. I wash my hands very often, especially every time I wash for 20 to 30 seconds. I wear a mask when I go out to places around town. I keep a 6-foot distance from people I don't live with. </p>
